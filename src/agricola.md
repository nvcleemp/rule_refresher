## Basic Rules
### Turn Structure (Each Round)
1. **Round Start**
   - Reveal a new **Round Card** (new action space available).
   - Add resources to accumulating action spaces.
2. **Work Phase**
   - Players take turns placing one **Family Member** at a time on an available action space.
   - Actions include **gathering resources, plowing fields, building fences, expanding family, etc.**
3. **Return Workers**

4. **Feeding Phase (Certain Rounds)**
