# Villagers - Rule Refresher

## Setup
- Place the **Market Board** in the center.
- Shuffle and place **Villager Deck** face-down.
- Create **6 face-up stacks** (2 cards each) as the **Road**.

- Set aside **Food & Building Bonus Tokens**.
- Each player starts with:
  - **Founders Village Card**
  - **5 Hand Cards** from the deck
  - **Gold Reserve based on player count**

## Basic Rules
### Turn Structure (Each Round)
1. **Draft Phase**
   - Players take turns selecting villagers from the Road (number depends on food icons owned).
   - Refill Road at end of phase.

2. **Build Phase**
   - Players play villagers into their village (number depends on build icons owned).
   - Some villagers require others to be built first (chain system).
   - Pay costs where required (some require unlocking via another player).

3. **Market Phase (Only on Scoring Rounds)**
   - Players earn gold from villagers with a **coin symbol**.
   - Silver Villagers give extra income.
   - First Market triggers **halfway**; Second Market at **end of game**.

### Scoring & End of Game
- **Triggered at Second Market Phase**.
- Players score:
  - **Coins from villagers**.
  - **Bonus Tokens**.
  - **Extra points from certain villagers**.
- Most coins wins!

## Exceptions & Special Rules
- **Locked Villagers**: Require another playerâ€™s villager to be built first (pay them gold).
- **Founders**: Can always be played for free.
- **Discarding**: If hand limit is exceeded, discard excess cards.
- **Solo Mode**: Not covered here.

**Build wisely and prosper!**
