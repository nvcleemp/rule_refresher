# Pandemic - Rule Refresher

## Setup
- Place the **main board** in the center.
- Shuffle and deal **role cards** (each player gets one unique role).
- Place **infection cubes** in 9 cities based on initial infection draws.
- Each player starts with **2-4 Player Cards** (based on player count).
- Place **Research Stations**, starting with one in **Atlanta**.
- Set **infection rate** and place the **outbreak marker** at 0.
- Prepare the **Player Deck**, inserting Epidemic Cards based on difficulty.

## Basic Rules
### Turn Structure (Each Round)
1. **Perform 4 Actions** (choose from):
   - **Move** (Drive, Direct/Charter Flight, Shuttle Flight)
   - **Treat Disease** (Remove 1 cube per action)
   - **Build a Research Station**
   - **Share Knowledge** (Give/Take city card with another player in same city)
   - **Discover a Cure** (At a Research Station, discard 5 city cards of same color)

2. **Draw 2 Player Cards**
   - If an **Epidemic Card** is drawn:
     - Increase infection rate
     - Draw bottom card of Infection Deck, place 3 cubes
     - Shuffle discarded Infection Cards and place them on top

3. **Infect Cities**
   - Flip cards from Infection Deck equal to infection rate.
   - Add 1 cube of matching color to each city.
   - If a city reaches 4 cubes, an **outbreak** occurs, spreading cubes to adjacent cities.

### Winning & Losing Conditions
#### Win:
- Discover cures for **all four diseases**.

#### Lose:
- If the **Outbreak Marker** reaches the final space.
- If there are no more **disease cubes** of a needed color.
- If the **Player Deck** runs out.

## Exceptions & Special Rules
- **Roles**: Each role has a unique ability (e.g., Medic treats all cubes in one action, Scientist discovers cures with 4 cards).
- **Outbreak Chain Reaction**: If an outbreak causes another city to reach 4 cubes, it triggers another outbreak.
- **Eradication Bonus**: If all cubes of a cured disease are removed, it no longer spreads.
