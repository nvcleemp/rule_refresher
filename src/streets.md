2. **Attract Meeples**
   - Properties with **icons** attract corresponding **meeples**.
   - Meeples move from other properties if applicable.

3. **Check for Street Closure**
   - A street is closed when both ends are blocked by buildings.
   - When closed:
     - Score **each property** based on meeples and bonuses.
     - Owners receive **money** for scoring.
     - Meeples move to adjacent open streets if possible.

4. **Draw a New Property Card**
   - Refill your hand to **4 cards**.

### Scoring & End of Game
- Game ends when all players have placed their last property.
- Final round scoring includes:
  - **All closed streets**.
  - **Remaining meeples on open streets lose value**.
  - Most money wins!

## Exceptions & Special Rules
