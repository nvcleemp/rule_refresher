# RoboRally - Rule Refresher

## Setup
- Each player chooses a **robot**.
- Place the **game board** with **checkpoints** as per scenario or freely chosen.
- Each player places their **robot** on the starting position.
- Shuffle and place the **Programming Deck** nearby.
- Determine the **first player** randomly.

## Basic Rules
### Turn Structure (Each Round)
1. **Program Phase**
   - Players draw **9 Program Cards** (or less in case of damage).
   - Choose **5 cards** to set their movement order.
   - Place them face down in order.

2. **Activation Phase**
   - Reveal program cards one at a time, executing movements in priority order.
   - Movements include:
     - **Move Forward/Backward**
     - **Rotate Left/Right/U-Turn**
   - Robots can **push each other** if they collide.

3. **Board Elements & Combat**
   - After all players execute their movement, board elements activate:
     - **Conveyor Belts** move robots.
     - **Gears** rotate robots.
     - **Pushers** activate.
   - Lasers and robots **fire and deal damage**.

4. **End of Round & Repairs**
   - If a robot reaches a **checkpoint**, it is marked.
   - Reboot any destroyed robots at the last saved checkpoint.

### Power down
- A player can decide to power down **for the next round**.
- **All damage tokens are removed** at the start of the power down.
- The robot stays on the board and can **receive damage**.


### Scoring & End of Game
- The first player to **touch all checkpoints in order** wins.
- If a robot is destroyed, it respawns at its last checkpoint and **looses a life**.

## Exceptions & Special Rules
- **Locked Registers**: Severe damage can lock movement cards.
- **Upgrades**: Some variants allow for robot upgrades during play.

**Plan ahead and navigate the chaos!**
